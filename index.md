Innovative, Collaborative, Exploratory Cold Regions Organism Library for Discovery in Biotechnology

What is it?

 - A collection of microorganisms (i.e. bacteria and fungi) originating from Cold Regions soil, snow, and ice.

Exciting Features of Microbes

 - They can be used for biotechnology.

  1. Bacteria produce a wide range of enzymes, proteins, and sugars, which can be harvested for use in synthetic biology applications.

  2. Psychrophiles and psychrotrophs may be able to carry out useful processes and interactions, such as bioremediation, in low-temperature conditions.

 - They can inform critical environmental processes.

  1. As our climate warms, frozen regions of the planet will begin to thaw, releasing trapped carbon and previously dormant organisms into the ecosystem.

  2. Culturing and characterizing these organisms helps to fill in our knowledge of environmental microbes.

Where do they come from?

  1. Arctic

  2. Antarctic

  3. High altitudes
